Most URIs in a stream are infinitely cacheable but the head by default will not cache. It may be preferable in some situations to set a small amount of caching on the head to allow intermediaries to handle polls (say 10 seconds). The argument is an integer representing the seconds to cache.

For example, if you set <code>$maxAge</code> to 10 and <code>$maxCount</code> to 50,000, events will be marked as eligible for scavenging after either 10 seconds, or 50,000 events, have passed. Deleted items will only actually be removed once the scavenge process is run.</p>\n</div>\n<p sourcefile=\"server/metadata-and-reserved-names.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"39\" sourceendlinenumber=\"39\">Security access control lists are also included in the <code>$acl</code> section of the stream metadata.</p>\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Name</th>\n            <th>Description</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>$r</td>\n            <td>The list of users with read permissions</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>$w</td>\n            <td>The list of users with write permissions</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>$d</td>\n            <td>The list of users with delete permissions</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>$mw</td>\n            <td>The list of users with write permissions to stream metadata</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>$mr</td>\n            <td>The list of users with read permissions to stream metadata</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p sourcefile=\"server/metadata-and-reserved-names.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"72\" sourceendlinenumber=\"72\">You can find more details on access control lists can <a href=\"~/server/access-control-lists.md\" data-raw-source=\"[here](access-control-lists.md)\" sourcefile=\"server/metadata-and-reserved-names.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"72\" sourceendlinenumber=\"72\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"event-metadata\" sourcefile=\"server/metadata-and-reserved-names.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"74\" sourceendlinenumber=\"74\">Event Metadata</h2>\n<!--  TODO: Is this duplicated or different?-->\n<p sourcefile=\"server/metadata-and-reserved-names.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"78\" sourceendlinenumber=\"78\">Every event in Event Store can have metadata associated with it.
