{"conceptual":"\n<p sourcefile=\"server/caching.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"3\" sourceendlinenumber=\"3\">As there are large differences between running Event Store in development and production, it&#39;s important to understand how caching works.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"server/caching.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"5\" sourceendlinenumber=\"5\">Most of the URIs that Event Store emits are immutable (including the UI, Atom Feeds, etc). You can see an example of this in an Atom feed.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"server/caching.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\" sourceendlinenumber=\"7\">An Atom feed has a URI that represents an event, e.g. <code>/streams/foo/0</code>, representing &#39;event 0&#39;. The data for event 0 will never change. If this stream is open to public reads then the URI will be set to be &#39;cachable&#39; for long periods of time. You can see a similar example in reading a feed, if a stream has 50 events in it the feed page <code>20/forward/10</code> will never change, it will always be events 20-30. Internally Event Store controls serving the right URIs by using <code>rel</code> links with feeds (for example <code>prev</code>/<code>next</code>).</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"server/caching.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"9\" sourceendlinenumber=\"9\">This caching behaviour is great for performance in a production environment and is highly recommended. In a developer environment it can be confusing. For example, what would happen if you started a database, wrote <code>/streams/foo/0</code> and performed a <code>GET</code> request. This <code>GET</code> request is cachable and now in your cache. Since this is a development environment, you shutdown and delete the database. You then restart it and write a different event to <code>/streams/foo/0</code>. You open your browser and inspect the <code>/streams/foo/0</code> stream, and you will see the event written before you deleted the database.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"server/caching.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\" sourceendlinenumber=\"11\">To avoid this it&#39;s best to run Event Store with the <code>--disable-http-caching</code> command line option. This will disable all caching and solve the issue.</p>\n","type":"Conceptual","source":{"remote":{"path":"server/caching.md","branch":"swagger-docfx","repo":"git@github.com:EventStore/docs.geteventstore.com.git"},"startLine":0,"endLine":0,"isExternal":false},"path":"server/caching.md","documentation":{"remote":{"path":"server/caching.md","branch":"swagger-docfx","repo":"git@github.com:EventStore/docs.geteventstore.com.git"},"startLine":0,"endLine":0,"isExternal":false},"_docfxVersion":"2.31.0.0","_systemKeys":["conceptual","type","source","path","documentation","title","rawTitle","wordCount"],"title":"Caching","rawTitle":"<h1 id=\"caching\" sourcefile=\"server/caching.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"1\" sourceendlinenumber=\"1\">Caching</h1>","wordCount":259,"_lang":"csharp","_tocPath":"docs/toc.html","_rel":"../../","_path":"docs/server/caching.html","_key":"server/caching.md","_tocRel":"../toc.html","_tocKey":"~/toc.md","__global":{"classesInSubtitle":"Classes","structsInSubtitle":"Structs","interfacesInSubtitle":"Interfaces","enumsInSubtitle":"Enums","delegatesInSubtitle":"Delegates","constructorsInSubtitle":"Constructors","fieldsInSubtitle":"Fields","propertiesInSubtitle":"Properties","methodsInSubtitle":"Methods","eventsInSubtitle":"Events","operatorsInSubtitle":"Operators","eiisInSubtitle":"Explicit Interface Implementations","functionsInSubtitle":"Functions","membersInSubtitle":"Members","improveThisDoc":"Improve this Doc","viewSource":"View Source","inheritance":"Inheritance","inheritedMembers":"Inherited Members","namespace":"Namespace","assembly":"Assembly","syntax":"Syntax","overrides":"Overrides","implements":"Implements","remarks":"Remarks","examples":"Examples","seealso":"See Also","declaration":"Declaration","parameters":"Parameters","typeParameters":"Type Parameters","type":"Type","name":"Name","description":"Description","returns":"Returns","fieldValue":"Field Value","propertyValue":"Property Value","eventType":"Event Type","exceptions":"Exceptions","condition":"Condition","extensionMethods":"Extension Methods","note":"<h5>Note</h5>","warning":"<h5>Warning</h5>","tip":"<h5>Tip</h5>","important":"<h5>Important</h5>","caution":"<h5>Caution</h5>","_shared":{}}}
