<h1 id="deleting-streams-and-events">Deleting streams and events</h1>

<p>Meta data in Event Store defines whether an event is deleted or not. Stream metadata such as &quot;Truncate Before&quot;, &quot;Max Age&quot; and &quot;Max Count&quot; is used to filter out events considered deleted. When reading a stream, the index will check the stream&#39;s metadata to determine whether any of its events have been deleted.</p>
<p><code>$all</code> bypasses the index, meaning that it does not check the metadata to determine whether events exist or not. As such, events that have been deleted will still be readable until a scavenge has removed them. There are a number of requirements for a scavenge to successfully remove events, for more information about this, please see the section on <a href="scavenging.html">Scavenging</a>.</p>
<div class="WARNING"><h5>Warning</h5><p>The last event in a stream is always kept as a record of the last event number in the stream.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="soft-delete-and-truncate-before">Soft delete and Truncate before</h3>
<p><strong>Truncate before</strong> (<code>$tb</code>) considers any event with an event number equal to or lower than its value to be deleted.
For example, if you had the following events in a stream :</p>
<pre><code class="lang-text">0@test-stream
1@test-stream
2@test-stream
3@test-stream
</code></pre><p>If you set the truncate before value to 2, a read of the stream would result in only the last event being read :</p>
<pre><code class="lang-text">3@test-stream
</code></pre><p><strong>Soft delete</strong> makes use of Truncate before. When a stream is deleted, its Truncate before is set to the streams current last event number. When a soft deleted stream is read, the read will return a <code>StreamNotFound</code> or <code>404</code> result.
After deleting the stream, you are able to write to it again, continuing from where it left off.</p>
<p>For example, if you soft deleted the above example stream, the truncate before would be set to 3 (the stream&#39;s current event number). If you were to write to the stream again, the next event would be written with event number 4. Only events from event number 4 onwards would be visible when reading this stream.</p>
<h3 id="max-count-and-max-age">Max count and Max age</h3>
<p><strong>Max count</strong> (<code>$maxCount</code>) limits the number of events that can be read from a stream.
If you try to read a stream that has a max count of 5, you will only be able to read the last 5 events regardless of how many events are actually in the stream.</p>
<p><strong>Max age</strong> (<code>$maxAge</code>) specifies the number of seconds an event can live for.
This age is calculated at the time of the read, so if you read a stream with a Max Age of 3 minutes and one of the events in the stream has existed for 4 minutes at the time of the read, it will not be returned.</p>
<h2 id="hard-delete">Hard delete</h2>
<p>A <strong>hard delete</strong> writes a tombstone event to the stream, permanently deleting it. The stream cannot be recreated or written to again.
Tombstone events are written with the event type <code>$streamDeleted</code>.
When a hard deleted stream is read, the read will return a <code>StreamDeleted</code> or <code>410</code> result.</p>
<p>The events in the deleted stream are liable to be removed in a scavenge, but the tombstone event will remain.</p>
<div class="WARNING"><h5>Warning</h5><p>A hard delete of a stream is permanent. The stream cannot be written to or recreated. As such, you should generally prefer to soft delete streams unless you have a specific need to permanently delete the stream.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="deleted-events-and-projections">Deleted events and projections</h2>
<p>If you are intending on using projections and deleting streams, there are some things to take into consideration:</p>
<p>Due to the nature of $all, projections using <code>fromAll</code> will read any deleted events that have not been scavenged away. They will also receive any tombstone events from hard deletes.</p>
<p>Projections that read from a specific stream will also receive that stream&#39;s metadata events. These can be filtered out by ignoring events with an event type <code>$metadata</code>.</p>
